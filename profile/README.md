# Welcome to the Bolt Programming Language

Here you'll find [Bolt](https://github.com/boltlang/Bolt), an experimental compiler that hopefully one day will successfully implement the Bolt programming language.

Feel free to take a look around. If something sparked your interest and you'd like to help, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/boltlang/Bolt/issues/new)!
